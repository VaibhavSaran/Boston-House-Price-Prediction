# [Boston House Price Prediction Live Deployment](https://boston-housing-deployment.herokuapp.com/)

## Acknowledgements
I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Krish Naik who made a video about deploying a ML project end to end using heroku and GitHub Actions. Following the video I was able to understand the concepts of deploying and how MLOPS and DevOPS make the deployment process a very and hassle free task.<br>

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project was to understand the fine details of how real time Machine Learning Project gets deployed in Industry using various applications. For this project Heroku and Github Actions were used.

## Data Collection
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/) was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978. Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics ...', Wiley, 1980. N.B. Various transformations are used in the table on pages 244-261 of the latter.

## Results Achieved
- Understood the complete cycle of deployment
- Understood the concepts of docker and docker images
- Gained a basic understanding of CI/CD pipelines, Heroku Apps and GitHub Actions
